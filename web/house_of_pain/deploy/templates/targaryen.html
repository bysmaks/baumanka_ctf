    <p>House Targaryen of Dragonstone, known poetically as the House of the Dragon, is an exiled Great House of Westeros and the former royal house of the Seven Kingdoms. House Targaryen conquered and unified the realm before it was deposed during Robert's Rebellion, where House Baratheon replaced it as the new royal house. The two surviving Targaryens, Viserys and Daenerys, fled into exile to the Free Cities of Essos across the Narrow Sea.</p>
